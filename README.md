# CSharpPhysEngine
A physics engine i'm writing in c# that uses a render.dll i built in c++ that uses opengl.

Textuers and shaders are currently located under Application/bin/Debug. If built for release these files must be copied over and relative directories maintained.

THIRD PARTY STUFF: compilerlib/\*, render/glad.c, render/stb_image.h, opengl32.lib
