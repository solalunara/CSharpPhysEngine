# CSharpPhysEngine
A physics engine i'm writing in c# that uses a render.dll i built in c++ that uses opengl.

This code on it's own won't compile, extra includes and libraries for render.dll to access opengl are required. They can be found at https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/Creating-a-window
